# JAVASCRIPT DATA VISUALISATION CHALLENGE  

-> [https://ariannatelesca.github.io/js-datavisualisation-challenge/](js-datavisualisatio-challanhge).

This project is a challange of the BeCode promo Swartz/6. I completed it on Juin 2022.

**THE MISSION**  

1. Inline data (data in the document)

In the html file, you will find two data tables. Use JavaScript to traverse the DOM to insert right above each of these tables a representation of its data in the form of an interactive graph.

If javascript is disabled, the graph does not appear. If javascript is enabled, the graph appears between the title and the table.  

2. Remote data, in real-time, via ajax

There are data sitting at this URL : [https://canvasjs.com/services/data/datapoints.php](https://canvasjs.com/services/data/datapoints.php).

Retrieve the data via Ajax, and use it to insert a graph that refreshes every second, just below the main title (h1) of the article.

Again: if javascript is disabled, the graph does not appear. If javascript is enabled, the graph appears.
